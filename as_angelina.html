        <p class = "desc">Angelina is friends with Mia, one of the main antagonists of the story. She was raised by wealthy parents
        and grew up in a rich neighborhood. Therefore, she is allowed to do whatever she wants. Her and Mia have been childhood 
        friends since middle school. They grew up with each other for so long that they even go to college together. Angelina considers
        Mia as her guardian angel and those who harm Mia as her personal enemies. Mia told Angelina that Astraea stabbed her in the back
        sometime during high school, tarnishing their friendship. Angelina holds pure disdain for Astraea as a result.</p>

        <p class = "desc">Angelina's view on everything is carefree and uninterested; she gets bored of things very easily. Her hair
            is very long, with one half being black and the other being blonde, though she is naturally blonde overall. Her outfits 
            embody the idea of royalty and superiority. She always wears pinks and reds because she sees those as royal colors.
            She never leaves the house without wearing some sort of gold jewelry and high heels to match her outfit.
