        <p class = "desc">Branch is Celaria's world-renowed librarian. She is known for having a crazy, yet outgoing personality.
            However, she is very professional with her work. You could say that she loves doing her job very much.
            Some of her favorite activities besides reading include rollerskating, planting, and teaching young
            pixies earth magic. Her role in the story is to aid Astraea and Dante on their journey to find and
            defeat the shadow demon.</p>
            
        <p class = "desc">Branch has curly green hair, with its shape resembling a bush that constantly has branches and leaves
            stuck in it all the time. She always wears orange and yellow. She has dark blue eyes with small hearts
            as pupils. Her wings are a pale blue, almost an iridescent color, matching the wings of other pixies
            in the kingdom. Her pupils are heart-shaped, a common trait amongst pixies.</p>
