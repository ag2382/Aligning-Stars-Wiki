        <p>Ms. Mushroom is a healer pixie (essentially a nurse) who resides in the Great Oak Tree,
            Celaria's primary care-center. She has a kind and quiet demeanor whose NUMBER ONE priority
            is to help people no matter what. Outside of her medical obligations, she likes to bake and  
            make healing potions in her spare time. Her purpose later on in the story is to help Astraea locate 
            the shadow demon and find her true powers.</p>
        <p>She has a blonde bob and a mushroom cap. She wears a light pink dress, with its ends resembling
            flower petals. She also wears heels to make herself appear taller. Her wings are much like the 
            other pixies residing in Celaria. Her color scheme consists of a combination of reds, pinks, and corals,
            with a hint of magenta in her eyes. Much like Branch and the other Celarian pixies, her pupils are also
            in the shape of hearts.</p>
