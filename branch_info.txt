"Well done, my children! I am so proud of you all."
- Branch

Branch is Celaria's world-renowed librarian. She is known for having a crazy, yet outgoing personality.
However, she is very professional with her work. You could say that she loves doing her job very much.
Some of her favorite activities besides reading include rollerskating, planting, and teaching young
pixies earth magic. Her role in the story is to aid Astraea and Dante on their journey to find and
defeat the shadow demon.

Branch has curly green hair, with its shape resembling a bush that constantly has branches and leaves
stuck in it all the time. She always wears orange and yellow. She has dark blue eyes with small hearts
as pupils. Her wings are a pale blue, almost an iridescent color, matching the wings of other pixies
in the kingdom. Her pupils are heart-shaped, a common trait amongst pixies.
